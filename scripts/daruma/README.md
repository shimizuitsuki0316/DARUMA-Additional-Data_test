# Disorder order clAssifier by Rapid and User-friendly Machine, DARUMA
DARUMA (Disorder order clAssifier by Rapid and User-friendly Machine) is a predictor for intrinsically disordered regions(IDRs). 
DARUMA enables rapid prediction by using a simple convolutional neural network that uses physicochemical properties of amino acids as features.
Developed by Fukuchi Lab, Maebashi Institute of Technology.


**cpu/**: The CPU version is compatible with a wide range of CPUs and can be executed on Python 2 or 3 with the numpy library.

**gpu/**: The execution time of the GPU version is significantly faster than that of the CPU version.
